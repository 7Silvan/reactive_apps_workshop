## Fourth excercise
go to src/stock/containers/stock-page/stock-page.container.ts

We have implemented the filter functionality and the matching wines.

You can update the favoritewines so it uses a stream instead of an object. As a result your constructor will be empty.

You can create a stream of how many wines there are and render it in the view (look for todo).

You can create a stream of how much money your winecellar is worth and render it in the view (look for todo).

## Bonus excercise
Refactor the collapsable sidebar in src/common/containers/collapsable-sidebar/collapsable-sidebar.container.ts to use streams and make sure you don't have any subscribes anymore.
