## First excercise

implement the reducers in src/statemanagement/reducers

There are 4 of them: appliation.reducer.ts, collapsable-sidebar.reducer.ts, wines.reducer.ts and authentication.reducer.ts

You will see that the tests are already implemented
With the use of wallaby.js it should be very easy to implement.

**Remember**:
Reducers should be immutable
Reducers are pure functions and have no dependencies
Reducers always update a specific piece of the state
